# Exercise 8: Multiplication Table

## Difficulty: Intermediate

## Description
Write a program that prints the multiplication table for a given number.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn to use for loops
- Understand the range() function
- Practice string formatting

## Requirements
- Ask the user for a number
- Print the multiplication table for that number from 1 to 10
- Format the output neatly

## Expected Output
```
Enter a number: 7
7 x 1 = 7
7 x 2 = 14
7 x 3 = 21
7 x 4 = 28
7 x 5 = 35
7 x 6 = 42
7 x 7 = 49
7 x 8 = 56
7 x 9 = 63
7 x 10 = 70
```

## Hints
- Use a `for` loop with `range(1, 11)` to iterate from 1 to 10
- The loop variable will hold the current multiplier
- Multiply the input number by the loop variable

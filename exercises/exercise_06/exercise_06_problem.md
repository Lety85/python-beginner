## Learning Objectives
- Learn to use if/else statements
- Understand the modulus operator for checking divisibility
- Make decisions based on conditions

## Requirements
- Ask the user for a number
- Check if the number is even or odd
- Print an appropriate message

## Expected Output
```
Enter a number: 7
7 is odd.
```

or

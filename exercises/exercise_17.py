# Exercise 17: File Operations - Simple Note Taker
# Objective: Save and read notes from a file

# Hint: Use 'with open(filename, mode) as file:' syntax
# Hint: Mode 'a' appends, mode 'r' reads
# Hint: Use file.write() and file.readlines()
# Hint: Handle FileNotFoundError with try/except
# Hint: Use .strip() to remove newline characters

def add_note():
    # Get note from user
    # Open file in append mode and write note
    pass

def view_notes():
    # Try to open file in read mode
    # Read all lines and display them
    # Handle case when file doesn't exist
    pass

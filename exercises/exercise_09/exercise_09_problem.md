# Exercise 9: Sum of Numbers

## Difficulty: Intermediate

## Description
Write a program that calculates the sum of all numbers from 1 to N using a while loop.

## Learning Objectives
- Learn to use while loops
- Understand accumulator pattern
- Practice loop control with counters

## Requirements
- Ask the user for a positive integer N
- Calculate the sum of all numbers from 1 to N using a while loop
- Print the result

## Expected Output
```
Enter a positive number: 10
The sum of numbers from 1 to 10 is: 55
```

## Hints
- Use a `while` loop that continues until a counter reaches N
- Keep a running total (accumulator) that starts at 0
- Increment both the counter and the total in each iteration
- While loop syntax: `while condition:`

# Exercise 20: Prime Number Finder
# Objective: Find all prime numbers up to a given number

# Hint: A prime is only divisible by 1 and itself
# Hint: Check divisibility from 2 to sqrt(n)
# Hint: Use a function to check if a number is prime
# Hint: Use int(n**0.5) to get square root as integer
# Hint: Optimization: skip even numbers after checking 2

def is_prime(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    # Handle special cases (n < 2, n == 2, even numbers)

    # Check odd divisors from 3 to sqrt(n)

    pass

# Main program

# Get input from user

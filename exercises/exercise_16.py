# Exercise 16: List Comprehensions
# Objective: Practice creating lists using comprehensions

# Hint: Basic syntax: [expression for item in iterable]
# Hint: With filter: [expression for item in iterable if condition]
# Hint: Example: [x*2 for x in range(5)] creates [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]

# 1. Create list of squares from 1 to 10


# 2. Create list of even numbers from 1 to 20


# 3. Get sentence and create list of word lengths


# 4. Create list of uppercase words (only words > 3 chars)

# Exercise 9: Sum of Numbers
# Objective: Calculate sum of numbers from 1 to N using while loop

# Hint: Initialize counter = 1 and total = 0
# Hint: While loop continues while counter <= n
# Hint: Add counter to total, then increment counter
# Hint: Use += operator for adding to a variable

# Get N from user

# Initialize counter and total

# Use while loop to calculate sum

# Print the result

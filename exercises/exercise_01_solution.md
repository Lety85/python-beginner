# Exercise 1: Solution

## Code
```python
print("Hello, World!")
```

## Explanation
- The `print()` function outputs text to the console
- We pass the string `"Hello, World!"` as an argument to the function
- Strings in Python can be enclosed in either single quotes `'` or double quotes `"`
- This is the traditional first program in any programming language!

## Key Concepts
- **print() function**: Built-in function that displays output
- **Strings**: Text data enclosed in quotes
